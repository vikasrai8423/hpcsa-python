1) Write a program that creates a dictionary like this 
{
    1: "red" , 2: "Blue" , 3: "Orange"
}
Now take the key as input from the user and print its corresponding colour 
(Exception handle the code to terminate gracefully by printing 
Colour not found if the key doesnot exists )

2) Write a program that creates a list of 5 elements of your choice 
Now take the index that the user want the data of and print the value at that 
location 
Exception handle the code to  terminate gracefully by printing 
Value not found if the index doesnot exists 

3) Create program that takes age of the user as input 
and prints number of days that user has lived for 
Exception handle the code such that if the user has lived for more than 
100001 days then user should get the message
, you lived for so long , may be you will die soon:)

4) Complete the bits and pieces of the following below code 

def my_exception_store(): 
    my_int_list1=[]
    my_int_list2=[]
    my_het_list3=[]

    while(True):
        try:

            print("1) Create a positive numbered list  ")
            print("2) Create a negative numbered list  ")
            print("3) Create a heterogenous list ")
            print("4) Check if the element is present in the list ")
            print("5) Refresh the program to start with blank lists")
            print("6) Exit  ")
            
            choice = int(input("Please enter your choice !!!! "))

                print(f"3 : {my_het_list3}")
                
                while True:
